As a computational biologist, working with a fantastic team at the [WEHI](https://www.wehi.edu.au/news/genetic-discovery-gives-insight-causes-eye-disease) in Melbourne, Australia, I use genetic data to study diseases of the brain and the retina.  
I also like to play around with non-biological data (see Projects), and [teach R workshops](https://brendanansell.net/teaching.html).
